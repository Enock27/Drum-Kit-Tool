# Drum Kit ü•Å

A simple and interactive Drum Kit web application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. Each button is styled with a background image of the drum it represents, and the appropriate sound is played when the button is activated.

## Features
- **Interactive Buttons**: Clickable buttons styled with drum images.
- **Keyboard Support**: Play drum sounds using the keyboard keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons visually respond when clicked or pressed.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the buttons, background, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for playing sounds and handling user interactions.

## How It Works
1. **Button Clicks**: Clicking a button triggers the corresponding drum sound and a visual animation.
2. **Keyboard Presses**: Pressing a key (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) plays the associated drum sound and animates the button.
3. **Sounds**: Each button is linked to a specific drum sound:
   - `w`: Crash
   - `a`: Kick
   - `s`: Snare
   - `d`: Tom 1
   - `j`: Tom 2
   - `k`: Tom 3
   - `l`: Tom 4
